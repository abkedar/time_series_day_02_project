# Fitting your first RandomForest regressor model

## Let's write a function `q07_randomforest_regressor()` that
* Takes as input the path and column names.
* Load the data using the previous assignment function.
* Split the data into two pairs of arrays for train and test indices using the second function of this project. 
* Extract the values of the train and test for only the given column names.
* Fits a RandomForest model with default parameters model on it.
* Returns the mean RMSE.
* Set the hyperparameters for RandomForestRegressor as 'n_estimators=50, min_samples_leaf=30, random_state=10'
